This configuration is highly desirable for customers that want to pre-bake all artefacts required for deployment into the image, and where the dynamic selection of the driver version is not a requirement. This guide shows how to deploy the additional components onto a pre-installed system, but the steps could also be used to create a deployment image with the software pre-baked.","sidebar":"docs"},"quickstart/rke2-selinux":{"id":"quickstart/rke2-selinux","title":"RKE2 cluster with SELinux enabled","description":"SELinux, or Security-Enhanced Linux, is a security framework for Linux operating systems that provides an additional layer of access control and mandatory access controls (MAC) beyond the traditional discretionary access controls (DAC).
