is becoming a game changer. Edge computing is a model that processes data near the network edge where data is generated. It addresses the issues of latency, bandwidth, and data privacy more effectively than centralized cloud architectures. However, managing and orchestrating applications and services at the Edge is no easy task. Robust, lightweight, and reliable tools are needed — a challenge some open source tools are prepared to tackle. By combining Rancher Prime, Buoyant’s Linkerd, RKE2, and K3s, users get a state-of-the-art, highly secure, highly performant solution for unique edge requirements.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Buoyant-SUSE-logo-bf9dcd47e85ef0054a06176989c6d779.png" width="1808" height="284" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-architecture">Introducing the architecture<a href="#introducing-the-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the architecture" title="Direct link to Introducing the architecture">​</a></h2><p>Before we get into the &quot;how,&quot; let&#x27;s introduce the edge computing stack and examine why these tools work so well together for an edge computing scenario. If you are running Rancher, we recommend combining Rancher Prime, Buoyant&#x27;s Linkerd, RKE2, and K3s (for an overview of what each piece does, please refer to the table below).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Buoyant-SUSE-Edge-Computing-fbfe7a87141d5cd5062111fa3b32cd7d.png" width="914" height="507" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Why this stack for edge computing? First and foremost, they integrate seamlessly, which will save you a lot of headaches. Additionally, Linkerd and RKE2 significantly improve security, while Linkerd provides an additional layer of reliability. This stack is lightweight and resource efficient, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. And lastly, all these tools focus on operational simplicity. And when it comes to edge computing, that is incredibly important. With multiple disparate devices, you need a unified way to operate them all.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Project Name</th><th>What it is</th><th>Why for the edge?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://buoyant.io/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buoyant’s Linkerd</a></td><td>Open-source, security-first service mesh for Kubernetes</td><td>Provides security, reliability, and observability without any code changes. Is ultra-lightweight and easy to install with a small runtime footprint (this is key in edge computing where managing communication must be efficient)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.rancher.com/products/rancher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rancher Prime</a></td><td>Open-source multi-cluster Kubernetes orchestration platform</td><td>Flexible and compatible with any CNCF Kubernetes distribution, including K3s and RKE2, Rancher Prime proactively monitors cluster health and performance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://docs.rke2.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RKE2</a></td><td>CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution optimized for air-gapped, offline, or edge environments deployed at the core or near the edge.</td><td>Fully CNCF-certified, RKE2 improves security and simplicity of your Kubernetes deployment. It is designed to be secure, reliable, and lightweight, ideal for general-purpose computing and near-edge use cases.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://docs.rke2.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K3s</a></td><td>CNCF-certified ultra-lightweight Kubernetes distribution providing the best choice for clusters running at the edge.</td><td>Ideal for edge applications, allowing for simple deployment and management while still fully CNCF-certified. It is ultra-lightweight and optimized for resource-constrained environments and functions even in remote and disconnected areas.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Security, reliability, and observability are all critical concerns for edge computing, and it’s therefore important to choose an architecture that helps, rather than hinders, accomplishing these goals. An effective architecture will be simple to deploy and operate, using technologies in ways that play to their strengths, as described above. With Rancher and Linkerd, we can adopt an extremely simple architecture that nevertheless brings an enormous amount of functionality to the table:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Buoyant-SUSE-Joint-reference-architecture-1-fc6a321363abe740c2715efd748ace9a.png" width="1039" height="470" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Here, our instruments (on the left of the diagram) are connected to IoT “gateway” systems running Linux. By deploying k3s clusters with Linkerd all the way out on the edge gateways, we can use Linkerd’s secure multicluster capabilities to extend the secure service mesh all the way from the central cluster (shown on the right, running RKE) to the edge gateways themselves.</p><p>These tools all integrate seamlessly, providing a secure, reliable, observable edge platform that is lightweight and resource efficient. Now let&#x27;s explore why we believe these technologies are a perfect match for the edge.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-rancher-and-buoyants-linkerd">Why Rancher and Buoyant&#x27;s Linkerd?<a href="#why-rancher-and-buoyants-linkerd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Rancher and Buoyant&#x27;s Linkerd?" title="Direct link to Why Rancher and Buoyant&#x27;s Linkerd?">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration<a href="#seamless-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Integration" title="Direct link to Seamless Integration">​</a></h3><p>One of the most significant advantages of combining Rancher Prime, Linkerd, RKE2, and K3s is their compatibility. These tools are designed to work hand-in-hand, providing a seamless experience. Rancher provides the overarching platform to manage your Kubernetes clusters, including RKE2, K3s, EKS, AKS, GKE, etc. And Linkerd easily integrates with any Kubernetes distribution, adding a service mesh layer to your Rancher-managed clusters.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reliability-and-robustness">Reliability and Robustness<a href="#reliability-and-robustness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reliability and Robustness" title="Direct link to Reliability and Robustness">​</a></h3><p>Linkerd adds a layer of reliability and robustness to your Kubernetes clusters by providing traffic splitting, retries, and timeouts capabilities for your applications. With its fault-tolerance feature, Linkerd ensures your applications continue running smoothly, even in the event of a network failure.</p><p>RKE2 takes Kubernetes security to the next level. It includes several enhancements like CIS benchmark compliance, security by default, and defense in depth. These features, along with Linkerd&#x27;s ability to automate mutual TLS for all service-to-service communication, provide a secure environment for your Edge computing needs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lightweight-and-resource-efficient">Lightweight and Resource Efficient<a href="#lightweight-and-resource-efficient" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lightweight and Resource Efficient" title="Direct link to Lightweight and Resource Efficient">​</a></h3><p>Edge environments often have limited resources. K3s is designed explicitly for such situations. It is a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution with a significantly smaller footprint, consuming less than half the memory of a typical Kubernetes installation. This lightweight nature extends to Linkerd as well, which maintains a small runtime footprint, making it an ideal service mesh for Edge environments.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comprehensive-observability">Comprehensive Observability<a href="#comprehensive-observability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Comprehensive Observability" title="Direct link to Comprehensive Observability">​</a></h3><p>With numerous devices and applications running in various locations, clearly understanding their performance and issues is vital. The Rancher Prime, Linkerd, RKE2, and K3s stack addresses that by providing comprehensive observability capabilities.</p><p><strong>Rancher</strong> enables users to monitor and manage clusters from a unified interface, regardless of where they are deployed. With built-in monitoring and alerting tools, users get detailed insight into cluster health, allowing for quick identification and resolution of potential issues. <strong>Linkerd</strong> provides deep real-time data into your applications&#x27; performance and includes features such as request volume, success rates, and latency distributions for all meshed services. Users get a more granular level of observability into microservices communication, which is crucial in Edge computing scenarios where the network is notorious for being unstable and latency-sensitive. Linkerd also automatically adds mTLS to all service-to-service communication, adding security with no code changes, which is particularly valuable in Edge computing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operational-simplicity">Operational Simplicity<a href="#operational-simplicity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operational Simplicity" title="Direct link to Operational Simplicity">​</a></h3><p>When it comes to Edge computing, operational simplicity is key. Edge environments involve managing numerous devices, often spread across multiple geographical locations, making traditional management methods impractical. Rancher simplifies Kubernetes cluster management with an intuitive user interface and robust API. <strong>Rancher</strong> allows users to manage all their Kubernetes clusters from a single control point, whether in the cloud, data center, or Edge environments. This unified approach simplifies operations and reduces the complexity of managing multiple clusters. </p><p>The <strong>Linkerd</strong> service mesh requires minimal configuration and comes with zero-config features such as load balancing, retries, timeouts, and more. With no time-consuming setup, developers have more time to build business logic. That being said, edge devices will require some initial setup work and configuration. Due to their resource limitations, these devices typically require deployment optimization to ensure they run efficiently.</p><p><strong>Linkerd Architecture:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Buoyant-SUSE-Linkerd-architecture-8509c72ae1829e63ab4ceacdb3a21d69.png" width="528" height="682" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Linkerd architecture is fairly simple. The Linkerd control plane manages Linkerd’s operation; it also has a CLI that the user can use to configure, and examine, the mesh. Application Pods that are part of the mesh have the ultra-fast, ultra-lightweight Linkerd proxy, purpose-built in Rust, injected into them as a sidecar container. Once the proxy is injected, all application communication goes through the proxy, which manages mTLS, workload authentication and authorization, retries, circuit breaking, metrics collection, and much more. Having these critical features uniformly applied across the entire application at the platform level eliminates the need to change the application itself, meaning that the application developers are free to focus on the business needs of the application rather than on the complexities of the network.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="edge-computing-use-case-examples">Edge computing use case examples<a href="#edge-computing-use-case-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Edge computing use case examples" title="Direct link to Edge computing use case examples">​</a></h2><p>Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, retail, and energy are all increasingly taking advantage of edge computing to optimize their operations.
